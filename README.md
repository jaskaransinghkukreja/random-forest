# End-to-End Machine Learning Workflow Implementation
This project focuses on building a complete machine learning pipeline starting from raw data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and dimensionality reduction. It demonstrates how different preprocessing techniques influence model performance and prediction accuracy.

The project is designed as a hands-on implementation of core machine learning concepts used in real-world.
